You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

Example:

Input: s = "++++"
Output: true 
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

class Solution(object):
    def canWin(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        memo={}
        def calculator(s):
            if s not in memo:
                memo[s]=any(s[i:i+2]=='++' and not(calculator(s[:i]+'-'+s[i+2:])) for i in range(len(s)))
            return memo[s]
            
        
        return calculator(s)
