Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.
Example 1:
Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
Note:
The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.
