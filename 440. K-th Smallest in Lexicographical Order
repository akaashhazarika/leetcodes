Given two integers n and k, return the kth lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n].

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 13, k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= n <= 109


import collections
class Solution:
    def findKthNumber(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        curr = 1
        while k>1:
            counts = self.get_prefix(n,curr,curr+1)
            if 1+counts<=k:
                curr = curr+1
                k-=counts
            else:
                k-=1
                curr = curr*10
        return curr
    
    def get_prefix(self,n,n1,n2):
        steps = 0
        while n1<=n:
            steps+=min(n+1,n2)-n1
            n1*=10
            n2*=10
        return steps
