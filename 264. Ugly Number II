Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note:  

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.



from Queue import PriorityQueue
class Solution(object):
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        #Inspired By stephen Pochman Wonderful Solution
        i1,i2,i3=0,0,0
        ugly=[1]
        while len(ugly)<n:
            while ugly[i1]*2<=ugly[-1]:
                i1+=1
            while ugly[i2]*3<=ugly[-1]:
                i2+=1
            while ugly[i3]*5<=ugly[-1]:
                i3+=1
            ugly.append(min(ugly[i1]*2,ugly[i2]*3,ugly[i3]*5))
        return ugly[-1]
