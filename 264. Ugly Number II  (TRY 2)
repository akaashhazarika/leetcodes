Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note:  

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.


class Solution(object):
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        used = set() 
        res = [1,2,4,5]
        used = set(res)
        heapq.heapify(res)
        for i in range(n-1):
            val = heapq.heappop(res)
            for i in (2,3,5):
                if val*i not in used:
                    used.add(val*i)
                    heapq.heappush(res,val*i)
            
        val = heapq.heappop(res)
        return val
