Given an integer n, return 1 - n in lexicographical order.

For example, given 13, return: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

Please optimize your algorithm to use less time and space. The input size may be as large as 5,000,000.


class Solution:
    def lexicalOrder(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        temp = [str(i) for i in range(1,n+1)]
        temp.sort()
        temp = [int(i) for i in temp]
        return temp
