There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
             
             
             
 class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        left,right=[1]*len(ratings),[1]*len(ratings)
        for i in range(1,len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]:
                left[i]=left[i-1]+1
        for i in range(len(ratings)-2,-1,-1):
            if ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]:
                right[i]=right[i+1]+1
        result=0
        print(left,right)
        for a,b in zip(left,right):
            result+=max(a,b)
        return result
