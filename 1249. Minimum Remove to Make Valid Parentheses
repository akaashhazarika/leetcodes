Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters. 

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
Example 3:

Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
Example 4:

Input: s = "(a(b(c)d)"
Output: "a(b(c)d)"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is one of  '(' , ')' and lowercase English letters.


class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        st = []
        mapp = {}
        for i,a in enumerate(s):
            if a=='(':
                st.append(i)
            elif a==')':
                if st:
                    st.pop()
                else:
                    mapp[i]=True
        while st:
            mapp[st.pop()]='#'
        r=''
        for i,a in enumerate(s):
            if i not in mapp:
                r+=a
        return r
