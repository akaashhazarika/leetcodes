Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
             
             
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x==0:
            return 0
        if x<=2:
            return 1
        
        left,right = 1,x//2
        while left<=right:
            mid = (left+right)//2
            if mid*mid==x:
                return mid
            if mid*mid<x:
                left = mid+1
            else:
                right = mid-1
        return right
