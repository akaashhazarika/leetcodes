Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:

Given n will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        counter = 0 
        while head:
            head = head.next
            counter+=1
        head = dummy
        counter-=n
        while counter>0:
            head = head.next
            counter-=1
        head.next = head.next.next
        return dummy.next
