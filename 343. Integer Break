Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.



class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n==2 or n==3:
            return n-1
        product = 1
        while n>4:
            product*=3
            n-=3
        return product*n
