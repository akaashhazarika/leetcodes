Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

 



The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49


class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height or len(height)==1:
            return 0
        left,right = 0 ,len(height)-1
        area = 0
        while left<right:
            slab = min(height[left],height[right])
            width = right - left
            area = max(area, slab*width)
            if height[left]<height[right]:
                left+=1
            else:
                right-=1
        return area
