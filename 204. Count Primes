class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        prime = [True]*(n)
        for i in range(2,math.ceil(n**0.5)+1):
            for j in range(i*i,n,i):
                prime[j] = False
        res = []
        for i in range(2,n):
            if prime[i]:
                res+=i,
        return len(res)
