Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)



class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not nums or len(nums)==1:
            return nums
        output = [0] *len(nums)
        output[0] = 1
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            output[i] = output[i-1]*nums[i-1]
        prev = nums[-1]
        for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
            output[i] = prev* output[i]
            prev = prev*nums[i]
        return output
