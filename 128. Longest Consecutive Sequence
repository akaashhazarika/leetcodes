Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4



class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        present = set()
        for n in nums:
            present.add(n)
        result=0
        for n in nums:
            if (n-1) not in present:
                counter = 1
                next_number = (n+1)
                while next_number in present:
                    next_number+=1
                    counter+=1
                result = max(result,counter)
                
        return result
