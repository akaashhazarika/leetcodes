Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if not needle:
            return 0
        n = len(needle)
        lps = [0]*n
        i = 1
        matches = 0
        while i<n:
            if needle[i]==needle[matches]:
                matches+=1
                lps[i] = matches
                i+=1
            else:
                if matches!=0:
                    matches = lps[matches-1]
                else:
                    lps[i] = 0
                    i+=1
        
        i,j = 0,0
        n,m = len(haystack),len(needle)
        i = 0
        while i<n:
            if haystack[i]==needle[j]:
                i,j = i+1,j+1
            if j==m:
                return i-j
            elif i<n and j<m and haystack[i]!=needle[j]:
                if j:
                    j=lps[j-1]
                else:
                    i+=1
        return -1
