Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        
        citations.sort(reverse=True)
        last=0
        for index,value in enumerate(citations,1):
            if value>=index:
                last=index
                pass
            else:
                break
        return last
    """
    ###Second solution is bucket sort:
        bucket=[0]*(len(citations)+1)
        for i in citations:
            bucket[min(i,len(citations))]+=1
        val=0
        for i in range(len(citations),-1,-1):
            val+=bucket[i]
            if val>=i:
                return i
        return 0
