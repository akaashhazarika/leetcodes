You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds.  These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1].  We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event ([0, T]).  If the task is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
Example 2:

Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 
We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].
Example 3:

Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
Example 4:

Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.
 
 
class Solution:
    def videoStitching(self, clips: List[List[int]], T: int) -> int:
        clips.sort(key = lambda v: (v[0]))
        print(clips)
        dp = [float('inf')] * len(clips)
        for i in range(0,len(clips)):
            if clips[i][0]==0:
                dp[i] = 1
            for j in range(0,i):
                if clips[j][1]>=clips[i][0]:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i],dp[j]+1)
        minim = float('inf')
        print(dp)
        for i in range(len(clips)):
            if clips[i][1]>=T:
                minim = min(minim,dp[i])
        return -1 if minim==float('inf') else minim
