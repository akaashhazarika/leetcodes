Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.


class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        mapp={}
        start,end=0,0
        maxlen=0
        unique=0
        while end<len(s):
            c=s[end]
            mapp[c]=mapp.get(c,0)+1
            end+=1
            if mapp[c]==1:
                unique+=1
            while unique>2:
                c=s[start]
                mapp[c]=mapp[c]-1
                if mapp[c]==0:
                    unique-=1
                start+=1
            maxlen=max(maxlen,end-start)
        return maxlen
