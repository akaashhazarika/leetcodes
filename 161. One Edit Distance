Given two strings s and t, determine if they are both one edit distance apart.

Note: 

There are 3 possiblities to satisify one edit distance apart:

Insert a character into s to get t
Delete a character from s to get t
Replace a character of s to get t
Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", t = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cab", t = "ad"
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.
Example 3:

Input: s = "1203", t = "1213"
Output: true
Explanation: We can replace '0' with '1' to get t.



class Solution(object):
    def isOneEditDistance(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        for index,(x,y) in enumerate(zip(s,t)):
            if x==y:
                continue
            else:
                if len(s)==len(t):
                    return s[index+1:]==t[index+1:]
                if len(s)<len(t):
                    return s[index:]==t[index+1:]
                else:
                    return s[index+1:]==t[index:]
        return abs(len(s)-len(t))==1
