Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?


class Solution(object):
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # n = len(nums)
        # agg = n*(n+1)/2
        # return agg - sum(nums)
        missing = len(nums)
        for idx,value in enumerate(nums):
            missing^=(idx^value)
        return missing
